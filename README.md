An `Educational C COmpiler` written in Rust, written for use in Charles Averill's Practical Compiler Design course. See https://github.com/CharlesAverill/ecco

## Installation

Install Rust. Ideally from your distro's repositories (if they are sufficiently up to date) or from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

Basic `cargo` commands apply, such as `cargo run <input file>` to build and run it.

Built in test-cases via `cargo test` are planned.
